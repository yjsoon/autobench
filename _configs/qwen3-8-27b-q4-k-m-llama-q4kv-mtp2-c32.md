  GGUF UD-Q4_K_M is the selected memory-saving llama.cpp format for this UMA Vulkan machine. The inventory proved BF16 in native torch, not native low-bit arithmetic; the page therefore records the Vulkan quant path without claiming a hardware-native format.

  Shared UMA method would use baseline host MemAvailable minus the 2-second minimum, with one accelerator summed. No publishable peak was recorded for this blocked attempt; static reservations are not a footprint.
spec_acceptance: >-
  Acceptance metric was not emitted or was not parseable before teardown; speculative result is blocked; num_speculative_tokens=2.

## Notes

- Status: blocked. Exact observed error/reason: MTP2 q4_0-KV q8 median TTFT 4892.35 ms exceeded the 2x SLO threshold 4000.00 ms; c32 was not launched.
- No complete memory trace was published for this attempt.
- Checkpoint revision: unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF@4ca720788d1e01f1bff70c033e0d0028fd02e502; base Qwen3.8-27B config revision: 1d4bf0f2ff6012fd82039f2fa52739d0dd7c60c0.
- Container behavior flags: --device /dev/kfd, --device /dev/dri, --ipc=host, --shm-size 32g, --security-opt seccomp=unconfined; no extra engine environment variable was set.
- Context-pool adaptation: llama.cpp used -c 65536 as the total context pool with --parallel c; the c8 server measured n_ctx_slot=8192, so context is not 65536 tokens per request at c8. Text-only serving explicitly passed --no-mmproj.
- External recipe source: https://github.com/sudoingX/qwen38-mtp@431bf8a821d49e6ac919febc7a91fb2434318110; file SHA256s: README.md=47dc7f471af4668159359c6f6b14a04c9dc18fd6aa7f1ab223b0efdca110b44; serve_mtp.sh=b2e19c0b0f0b10b8aea9c8601dcc9adeb5dbbe443015895fb5ba698bd7153223; probe.py=d9ea0c9fb10435937c774d4b182a6b5ac8481837e8b3d1aa23738eeb178dfd5f.
- Recipe adaptation: applied --cache-type-k q4_0 --cache-type-v q4_0 -fa 1 --spec-type draft-mtp --spec-draft-n-max 2; the repository's probe.py was not used as the headline harness, because autobench's closed-loop ShareGPT generator supplies the recorded aggregate metrics.
- Workload uses the first human turn of the first N ShareGPT conversations with one, file order, no shuffle or length filter. Local SHA256 is 35f0e213ce091ed9b9af2a1f0755e9d39f9ccec34ab281cd4ca60d70f6479ba4; the task-supplied SHA256 d7094af68bb58022696728841937d7285db423eba9d055b3386797b28db2cbdb differs. max_tokens=256; thinking disabled uniformly.
- TTFT is first streamed content token, skipping leading role/empty chunks. TPOT excludes the first completion token. prefill_toks/decode_toks are whole-server aggregates; at c32, per-user decode is aggregate decode divided by the in-flight count.
- Computed fit arithmetic: selected model files (including any draft sidecar where applicable) 16.609 GiB; KV 1.125 GiB; recurrent state 4.734 GiB; total 22.469 GiB; fit=yes. KV formula: 2 x 16 x 4 x 256 x (18 bytes / 32 values = 0.5625 bytes/value) for q4_0 K/V; GDN recurrent state is 48 x 48 x 128 x 128 x 4 bytes plus approximately 7.5 MiB convolution state per sequence.
- The engine emitted no parseable numeric KV/weight/memory breakdown before teardown; no value was inferred.
- Engine allocation cross-check: the saved logs emitted no numeric KV-cache size, weight/activation/non-torch breakdown, or engine-reported maximum concurrency; n_slots/n_ctx_slot and max_running_requests are configured settings, while the KV/state totals above are computed.
- Telemetry: busy peak/median None/None%, temperature peak None C, power median/peak None/None W, sustained clock median None MHz.
- Speculation acceptance: Acceptance metric was not emitted or was not parseable before teardown; speculative result is blocked; num_speculative_tokens=2.
- Cross-check anchor: not assessable because this MTP configuration was blocked before acceptance metrics; the previous-generation ShareGPT MTP anchor is 67% average, per-position 0.84/0.66/0.51, mean length about 3.0 at three draft tokens.
- Adaptation: shared UMA and one accelerator were measured here; the watchdog floor is the machine-specific 8 GiB safety floor; local amd64 images are pinned by local digest; BF16 is the only narrow format proven by the native probe; TP is not applicable. Recipe tag strix-halo-vulkan is defined once in SUMMARY.md.
- Machine-state caveat: pre-existing container qwen38 was loaded before this run. It was observed idle (0.00% CPU, requests_processing=0, requests_deferred=0, and no log activity in the preceding 10 minutes); it was not stopped. The idle baseline and shared-memory deltas therefore include that background state, but no active competing request was observed.
- Candidate note: MTP2 q4_0-KV q8 median TTFT 4892.35 ms exceeded the 2x SLO threshold 4000.00 ms; c32 was not launched.
