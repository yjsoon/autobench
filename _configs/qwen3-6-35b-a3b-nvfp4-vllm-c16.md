quant_rationale: conc-16 base (non-spec) point of the Qwen3.6-35B-A3B NVFP4 sweep — matched no-spec baseline for the MTP/DFlash conc-16 rows (EXPERIMENTS.md #4/#14). NVIDIA official ModelOpt NVFP4, same recipe as the published conc-32 base; only --max-num-seqs differs. Completes the base line of the speedup-decay curve.

**conc-16 base (no-spec) point of the Qwen3.6-35B-A3B NVFP4 sweep** — completes the matched base line for
the money-chart concurrencies (EXPERIMENTS.md #4/#14). Same NVIDIA ModelOpt NVFP4 recipe as the published
conc-32 base; only `--max-num-seqs` changes.

- **Result (conc 16):** prefill 349.96 / decode **332.42** tok/s aggregate; 784/1000 prompts (hit the 600 s
  cap), **0 errors**; peak mem 108.8 GB.
- **The base line is clean and monotone:** decode 74.7 (c1) → 113.2 (c2) → 173.8 (c4) → 241.8 (c8) → **332.4
  (c16)** → 430.8 (c32). A textbook throughput-vs-concurrency curve, no anomalies.
- **MTP-vs-base ratio — a robust ~+25–30% across the sweep, with a modest low-batch bump.** Ratios (MTP c1/c8 at matched
  600 s cap): +32.5% (c1) / +42.4% (c2) / +33.8% (c4) / +25.7% (c8) / **+30.3% (c16)** / +25.7% (c32). The apparent c8 "dip"
  (+19.5%) in the first pass was a **short-cap artifact**: the June MTP c8 was a 300 s-cap run (289 tok/s); a
  **matched 600 s-cap recheck gave 304 tok/s → +25.7%**, in line with the rest. So the curve is essentially
  **flat ~+25–30%** with a small **c2–c4 peak** (+42%/+34%) — a little batching still leaves spare compute for
  the 3-token draft — NOT a monotone decay. (Least-clean point is c2: base c2 was a 500-prompt run and MTP c2
  a 900 s run, so the +42% there mixes caps.) For the fully single-session apples-to-apples decay story, the
  DFlash-vs-MTP money chart is cleaner than this base-vs-MTP ratio.
- TPOT 0.0 = `qwen3` reasoning-parser client artifact — decode tok/s is the reported metric.
