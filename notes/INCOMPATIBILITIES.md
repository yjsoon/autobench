# Incompatibilities & gotchas

Engine/model-specific failures and their fixes, learned the hard way on GB10/Spark.
Referenced from `CLAUDE.md`. When a new wall is hit, record it here.

## llama.cpp

- **Dispatcher entrypoint:** `ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:full-cuda` (ARM64) uses a dispatcher
  entrypoint — run llama-bench via `--bench`, the server via `--server` (not the bare binary names).
- **gpt-oss = blocked (harmony):** llama-server's OpenAI chat endpoint can't parse gpt-oss's
  **harmony** channel output on build `b9744` — every `/v1/chat/completions` request 500s with
  "does not match the expected peg-native format" (raw `/completion` works, `--jinja` /
  `--reasoning-format none` don't help). Benchmark gpt-oss on **vLLM/SGLang** instead. Other
  (non-harmony) models serve fine on llama.cpp.

## vLLM

- **Transient EngineCore spawn deadlock on first launch — kill & retry.** Seen twice: a fresh
  `vllm serve` hangs at init (log frozen at `Enabled custom fusions: act_quant`, **no** EngineCore
  startup line, container ~0.2% CPU / weights never loaded). It's a **spawn race, not an
  incompatibility** — a clean `docker rm -f` + relaunch loads fine. Distinguish from a *real* failure
  (which prints a Python traceback / non-zero exit and reproduces every time): the deadlock is silent
  and clears on retry. Don't mark a config blocked on the first hang.
- **Nemotron NVFP4 headliners:** vLLM is the documented path
  (`--trust-remote-code --reasoning-parser nemotron_v3`); `cu130-nightly` serves
  Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-NVFP4 fine. An *older* NGC vLLM container rejected its
  `quant_algo: MIXED_PRECISION` against a hardcoded whitelist — use **cu130-nightly, not NGC**, for the
  NVFP4 Nemotrons.

### gpt-oss + vLLM — harmony tiktoken-vocab egress gotcha
At startup vLLM's `OpenAIServingResponses` loads the **harmony** encoding, whose rust `openai_harmony`
lib downloads `o200k_base.tiktoken` (sha256 `446a9538…`) from `$TIKTOKEN_ENCODINGS_BASE` (default =
openaipublic blob). The HF *model* download already used the run's **one** allowed external connection,
so this **second** fetch is egress-capped → `HarmonyError: failed to download or load vocab file` and
the server never comes up. Fix (baked into `scripts/bench-vllm-serving.sh`): pre-seed the vocab at
`~/models/tiktoken_cache/o200k_base.tiktoken`, mount it `-v …:/vocab:ro`, and set
**`TIKTOKEN_ENCODINGS_BASE=/vocab`** (a **plain path**, NOT `file:///vocab` — the rust file:// parser
fails with "No such file or directory"). No second egress then needed. Same applies to any
harmony/gpt-oss model on SGLang.

### Mistral native-format + MLA (Mistral-Small-4-119B-NVFP4)
The official NVFP4 repo (`mistralai/Mistral-Small-4-119B-2603-NVFP4`) ships **Mistral native format**
(`params.json`, `consolidated-*.safetensors`, `tekken.json` — no `config.json`), so vLLM needs
`--tokenizer-mode mistral --config-format mistral --load-format mistral`. The model is an **MLA**
(DeepSeek-V2-style) + Pixtral-vision arch, and vLLM's **Triton MLA decode kernel fails to compile on
GB10** (`triton_decode_attention` → `Cannot make_shape_compatible: incompatible dimensions 256 and
512`) — every request kills EngineCore. Fix: **`VLLM_MLA_DISABLE=1`** (use standard attention,
bypassing the broken kernel) **+ `--gpu-memory-utilization 0.90`** (MLA-disabled materializes full KV,
so 0.85 under-sizes the pool for 65536 ctx). `FLASHINFER_MLA` override is *ignored* (falls back to
Triton MLA) — disabling MLA is the only path that works on this build.

### Gemma-4 MTP on vLLM — was BLOCKED on 0.22, FIXED on nightly-aarch64 (0.23.1)
vLLM ships native gemma-4 MTP
(`--speculative-config '{"method":"mtp","model":"google/gemma-4-E<size>-it-assistant","num_speculative_tokens":N}'`).
Two walls historically blocked it on the older images; **both are resolved on `nightly-aarch64` (vLLM
0.23.1rc1)** — FP8+MTP now serves cleanly (measured 2026-06-23: E4B conc-32 decode ~1261 tok/s, accept
~44% / mean-len ~2.3; see `gemma-4-e4b-it-vllm-fp8-mtp`). **Retry vLLM walls on `nightly-aarch64` before
declaring a model-level block.** The history, for reference:
- **Wall 1 — arch not recognized:** the drafter's `gemma4_assistant` arch needs **transformers ≥ ~5.12**;
  stock `cu130-nightly` (vLLM 0.19.2rc1 / tf 5.6.0) rejected it at config-validation. (Worked around on
  0.22 by building `scripts/Dockerfile.vllm-022-tf` = vLLM 0.22.0 + tf 5.12.1.) `nightly-aarch64` ships a
  new-enough transformers and recognizes `Gemma4MTPModel` out of the box.
- **Wall 2 — TRITON_ATTN attention-group assertion (the hard blocker on 0.22):** `triton_attn.py
  get_num_attention_heads_from_layers` asserted uniform `num_heads` per group, but Gemma-4 E4B has
  **mixed `{8,4}` heads** (head_dim 256/512) which *force-pin* it to TRITON_ATTN; with MTP's draft layer
  the 0.22 metadata builder grouped differing head counts → `AssertionError`. **0.23.1 still forces
  TRITON_ATTN** (logs the heterogeneous-head message) but its metadata builder no longer trips the assert.
- **Caveat — NVFP4+MTP not yet on this image:** `nightly-aarch64` **regresses Gemma-4 NVFP4 *loading***
  (`gemma4.py tie_weights → NotImplementedError`, see image policy), so the NVFP4+MTP config can't simply
  ride it — needs retest when NVFP4 loading is fixed on a 0.23+ image. **llama.cpp** (`--spec-type
  draft-mtp`, unsloth merged-GGUF drafter; E-series needs `-fa off`) remains a working path for both.

## SGLang

- **`lmsysorg/sglang:spark` is too old for the Qwen3.6 (`qwen3_5`) arch (measured 2026-06-23).** The
  image ships **transformers 4.57.1**; loading any Qwen3.6 checkpoint fails at config load with
  `ValueError: model type 'qwen3_5' but Transformers does not recognize this architecture`. Needs
  transformers ~5.x — **and** a newer SGLang build with native Qwen3.6 model support (SGLang ships its
  own model classes, so a transformers bump alone likely won't suffice). Blocks all SGLang Qwen3.6 NVFP4
  configs (27B + 35B-A3B, base + MTP) — they're marked blocked; the vLLM `nightly-aarch64` runs carry the
  Qwen3.6 numbers. Revisit with a newer `lmsysorg/sglang` tag.

## Quant notes

- **NVFP4 (W4A4) is a genuine GB10 fast-path even for tiny models** — cosmicproc's `gemma-4-E4B-it-NVFP4`
  (ModelOpt, `FlashInferCutlassNvFp4LinearKernel`) beat FP8 on the same E4B by ~23% decode (the
  benchmark's fastest decode). Worth trying NVFP4 alongside FP8 wherever a trusted NVFP4 exists. (Trust:
  cosmicproc is an *individual* uploader — normally a BLOCK per the trusted-repo policy, run here on the
  user's explicit request; 61k dl/mo + a clean error-free result corroborated it.)

## Spec-decode acceptance — gpt-oss EAGLE3 on ShareGPT = poor & concurrency-degrading
The RedHatAI 20b / NVIDIA-throughput 120b EAGLE3 heads land **mean accept-len only ~1.0–1.7** (avg
draft accept ~1.5–25%) on the ShareGPT + harmony-reasoning stream — far below the ~3.0/~70% expectation
— and it **falls monotonically as concurrency/model-size rises** (20b ~1.7→1.2 over conc 1→8; 120b
~1.25→~1.05/~zero), the *opposite* of the constant-with-concurrency rule. Off-distribution draft tokens
also intermittently **corrupt the harmony channel** → `HarmonyError: unexpected tokens remaining in
message header` / `Unexpected token 0 while expecting start token 200006` (a handful of failed requests,
worse at higher conc). So the published gpt-oss-20b conc-32 "+28% decode" win is a scheduling/prefill
effect at that one batch size, NOT high acceptance — don't generalize it down the sweep, and the 120b
gains nothing at any concurrency. **Takeaway:** these EAGLE3 heads only pay off on **coding** workloads
(where acceptance is high); for general chat, expect spec-decode to be neutral or negative on gpt-oss.
Re-test on a code dataset before claiming an EAGLE3 win for any reasoning model.
